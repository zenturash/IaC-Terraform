# Azure VM OpenTofu Module - Project Intelligence

## Project Context
This is an OpenTofu (not Terraform) project for creating Azure Virtual Machines with a reusable module approach. The user specifically requested OpenTofu over Terraform, and this is a POC project focused on simplicity.

## Key User Preferences
- **OpenTofu over Terraform**: Always use OpenTofu terminology and ensure compatibility
- **Simplicity First**: This is a POC, so avoid over-engineering
- **Password Authentication**: User specifically wants password auth, not SSH keys
- **No NSG**: User explicitly said no Network Security Groups needed
- **Self-contained Module**: Module should create its own resource group

## Technical Patterns Discovered
- User prefers West Europe region as default
- Windows Server 2025 is the target OS
- VNet should be /20 with /24 subnet
- Comprehensive tagging is important (creation date, method, etc.)
- VM size and name should be configurable parameters

## File Organization Preferences
- Standard Terraform/OpenTofu module structure
- Separate variables, outputs, and versions files
- Examples directory for usage demonstrations
- Memory bank for project documentation

## Implementation Notes
- Use `formatdate("YYYY-MM-DD", timestamp())` for creation date tags
- Implement conditional public IP with count parameter
- Add VM size validation for Azure-specific sizes
- Use random suffix for resource group naming to avoid conflicts

## User Communication Style
- Direct and technical
- Prefers concise explanations
- Values working code over extensive documentation
- Appreciates POC-focused solutions

## Azure-Specific Considerations
- Target region: West Europe
- Use Premium_LRS for OS disks (better performance)
- Standard SKU for public IPs
- Dynamic IP allocation for private IPs
- Windows Server 2025 from MicrosoftWindowsServer publisher

## Development Workflow
1. Memory bank documentation first
2. Core module implementation
3. Example usage
4. Root configuration
5. Testing and validation

This project follows the Memory Bank pattern for documentation and uses standard OpenTofu module conventions.
