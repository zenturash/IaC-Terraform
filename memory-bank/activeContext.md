# Active Context - Azure Landing Zone (ALZ) OpenTofu Module

## Current Work Focus
Successfully completed implementation of a flexible Azure Landing Zone (ALZ) OpenTofu module with support for both single VNet and hub-spoke architectures. The project now provides variable-controlled deployment of Azure infrastructure.

## Recent Progress
✅ **ALZ Implementation Completed** (Just Completed)
- Created VNet peering module for hub-spoke connectivity
- Enhanced variables.tf with ALZ architecture controls
- Refactored main.tf for conditional deployments (single-vnet vs hub-spoke)
- Updated outputs.tf for both architecture modes
- Created example configurations for both architectures
- Updated comprehensive README with ALZ documentation

## Completed Components

### 1. VNet Peering Module (`modules/azure-vnet-peering/`)
- ✅ Bidirectional peering between hub and spoke VNets
- ✅ Support for multiple spoke VNets
- ✅ Configurable peering options (gateway transit, forwarded traffic)
- ✅ Complete variables, outputs, and versions files

### 2. Enhanced Variables System
- ✅ Architecture mode selection (`single-vnet` vs `hub-spoke`)
- ✅ Hub VNet configuration object
- ✅ Spoke VNets map for multiple workload VNets
- ✅ Component deployment controls (`deploy_components`)
- ✅ VNet peering configuration options

### 3. Conditional Main Configuration
- ✅ Smart resource placement (VPN in hub, VMs in spoke)
- ✅ Conditional hub VNet deployment
- ✅ Conditional spoke VNet(s) deployment
- ✅ Conditional VNet peering deployment
- ✅ Backward compatibility for single-vnet mode

### 4. Example Configurations
- ✅ `terraform.tfvars.single-vnet` (backward compatible)
- ✅ `terraform.tfvars.hub-spoke` (complete ALZ setup)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and usage examples

### 5. Enhanced Outputs
- ✅ Architecture-aware outputs
- ✅ Hub and spoke VNet information
- ✅ Peering status and configuration
- ✅ Deployment summary and connection guide

## Architecture Capabilities

### Single VNet Mode (Backward Compatible)
- All resources deployed in one VNet
- VPN Gateway and VMs in same network
- Original functionality preserved
- Simple deployment model

### Hub-Spoke ALZ Mode
- Hub VNet for connectivity (VPN, ExpressRoute)
- Multiple spoke VNets for workloads
- Automatic VNet peering configuration
- Centralized connectivity management
- Production-ready ALZ pattern

## Key Features Implemented
- **Variable-Controlled Deployment**: Complete control via terraform.tfvars
- **Flexible Architecture**: Choose single-vnet or hub-spoke
- **Component Control**: Deploy only what you need (VPN, VMs, peering)
- **Multiple Spoke Support**: Scale to multiple workload VNets
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing configs continue to work
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete README with examples

## Current Status
**Phase**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Full ALZ Implementation
**Architecture**: Dual-mode (single-vnet + hub-spoke ALZ)
**Status**: Ready for production deployment
**Next Steps**: User can deploy either architecture mode as needed

## Usage Examples Ready
1. **Single VNet**: `cp terraform.tfvars.single-vnet terraform.tfvars`
2. **Hub-Spoke ALZ**: `cp terraform.tfvars.hub-spoke terraform.tfvars`
3. **Custom Configuration**: Modify variables as needed

The project now provides a complete, flexible ALZ solution with full backward compatibility.
